# Pokédex

Pokédex a responsive application to be used on all types of operating systems—including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer 11 and Safari. It was developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, in addition to both jQuery and Bootstrap libraries. Users are able to retrieve the height and an image of all pokemen listed in the pokemon API by simply clicking a button with the name of the pokemon they wish to research, opening a modal that reveals these details.
