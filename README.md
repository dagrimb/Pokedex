# Pok√©dex

This is a responsive application that allows users to retrieve the height and an image of all pokemon listed in the pokemon API. Simply click the button with the name of the pokemon you wish to research and a modal will be opened that reveals these details. 

The objective of this project was to create a small web application with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This application was to load data from an external API (such as the Pokemon API--link below) and allow users to view specific data.
